Trigger Warning: Excrement

For those of you who missed the PowerPoint night of July 10, team survivalist Samuel Russ headlined the set with an informed and informaTIVE presentation tackling the sticky topic of "pooping in the woods."  I enjoyed the Powered Point on an aesthetic level (immaculate fonts, beautifully composed photographs) as well as an emotional one, for I am what doctors call a “shy pooper.”

Outdoor excreting does not come naturally to me.  I once went on a weeklong bathroomless canoe trip, and, I shit you not, I didn’t defecate for the duration.  Samuel’s wonderful display of techniques for doing one's duty deep in the woods proved quite heartwarming because I thought there might be some hope for me even with my “shy pooper” condition, or “ShPoo,” as we in the community call it.

Cut to: The next day, 6 pm.  After a routine bathroom trip for number one only, I begin my run, lunged and swung.  But something is off.  I’m not sick to my stomach exactly, but I feel…held back somehow.  Around mile 3, as I find myself trekking through obscure, remote trails, the sensation sinks to my low abdomen.  I realize in a split second (1) the thing holding me back from having a good run, and (2) what I need to do about it.

Like any reasonable ShPoo, I spend the next mile convincing myself that there is some other way.  _I’ve been through worse,_ I think to myself.  _I’ve felt the Running Induced Poops (RIPs) many times before and survived the run._  But the woods are too deserted for me to pass up this opportunity.

At the exact moment that I make up my mind to try the Woods Poop, the trail opens out into a full-on golf course.  I’m standing on the putting green, and there are people across the fairway, taking practice swings in my direction.  This is the worst possible place to look for crapping ground.  Panicked, I do a 180 and head back into the woods.  Samuel’s sage words float through my head like he’s Obie-Wan and I’m Luke doing the trench run.  “Go one see-far for number one, two see-fars for number two.”  _Use the force, Luke_.  "Use the see-fars, Jerry.”

I run until I can’t see the golfers anymore, then continue until I can’t see the spot where I first lost sight of them.  Two see-fars.  At this point, my run is more of a stagger because my body knows what’s about to go down, and it’s prepping the escape pod, as it were.  I manage to dig a small hole next to a tree, grab the tree, and lower myself to the angle that intuitively feels right (without a protractor on hand I’d say my knees were at an 80-degree angle).

As the feces exit my body, an eclectic goulash of emotions enters my heart.  I instantly feel the shame of shitting in the face of societal norms, exposing myself in this graphic way.  But pride enters the mix as well, pride that I’ve accomplished something I previously thought wasn’t in the cards for me.  And lastly, I feel a sense of grounding and sacred connection with the earth.  I am part of the ecosystem now.

All this is happening in a split second.  Meanwhile, the golfers have made their way onto the putting green.  They were talking pretty loudly as I was finding a spot and digging the hole.  I couldn’t make out what they were saying or see them directly, but I knew they were there.  And now, at the exact midpoint of my shit - THIS IS 100% TRUE, COULDN’T MAKE THIS UP IF I TRIED -  at the zenith of fecal velocity, the peak of poop power…

A cheer erupts from the putting green.

It has been 4 hours since that moment, and I have spent every _second_ of those four hours thinking about what. that. cheer. was. for.  There’s no way they could see me…right?  I used the see-fars!  The cheer was probably for someone getting a birdie or an eagle or whatever.  But the timing was too perfect, and it haunts me.  I can’t stop imagining them spotting a distant, mid-poop Jerry and giving their unsolicited support.

> Here’s the site of poop #1.  Was too busy vibing to San Salvador to take any other pictures

That would have been the end of it, but as I was leaving the park and heading into a neighborhood street, the RIPs came back even stronger.  If the previous urge took the form of a vague malaise, this one reared its head quickly and beat me into submission.  As if controlled by marionette strings, I found myself no longer heading down the neighborhood street but crashing back through the underbrush, looking for a concealed spot.

At this cliffhanger, we take an interlude for some background on my running practices.  I’m big on listening to music during runs that wouldn’t necessarily be associated with running, and my latest obsession - no bullshit, I’m serious - is Occitan folk chant group San Salvador.  They have a section in their song [La Grande Folie](https://open.spotify.com/track/1mK5SE4E4cF0FOemYttL7i?si=3c4c6b914a5a4094) where they repeat the same thing over and over, slowly adding more layers and getting gradually faster until it’s this frenzied mosaic of interlocking vocal lines (from 6:49 in that recording).

I happen to be listening to that part during my frantic search for a second poop spot, and let me tell you, my body is responding to that music.  The building momentum convinces my bowels that time is running out.  The siren call for complete rectal relaxation becomes almost uncontrollable, debilitating.  I no longer care about see-fars.  Heck, I am probably still technically in someone’s yard when I drop my pants.  Luckily, there’s a stream right there, so I am able to aim directly into it, eliminating the need for digging.  I pause San Salvador on my earbuds for maximum focus and let it rip.

This time, the sacred connection with the earth that I spoke about earlier is magnified tenfold into a truly cathartic cowpie.  Now I know how the Israelites felt walking on the swampy floor of the Red Sea with the power of nature’s restraint on full display.  I feel important and minuscule at the same moment.

But I had paused La Grande Folie on my earbuds as the momentum of the music was reaching its peak to focus on the duty at hand.  So when I hit play afterward, I’m treated to this epic climax, this culmination of everything the song has been building towards, when the long sustained chords from the very beginning come back.  It’s cathartic music, music that would have been _perfect_ for the cathartic crap I just had.  Without music, the crap carried me to cloud nine, but with San Salvador’s aid, I would have rocketed to nirvana.

So now, every time I listen to La Grande Folie, I’ll think of those woods, and of missed opportunities.

Love, 

Jerry
