### Training Update: June 5th, 2022

Before I start, a big thank you to Niels for setting up the blog and fixing the time-space continuum issues in the comments!

Today was my first long run of the summer – I ran from my house to the nearby Ragged Mountain Reservoir and back, logging about 7 miles on soft-surface trails.

On my run I encountered the first real hills I’ve seen in a long time, a relief from the flat landscape of Oberlin. It was also nice to run under dense tree cover, something found in Oberlin only around Little Rez and in the Arb. 

After my run, I tried my hand, as well as my abs, at our new circuit GS-K.  Highlights included “Eccentric Split Jumps” and Frog Hops. 

Unless someone else has submitted a post that hasn’t been processed yet, this might be the first post on the blog. I’m looking forward to seeing what everyone else is up to!
