Hello Teamo,

I write this to you on the train back to Rochester from a brief weekend in New York City for my sister's high school graduation (yay!). With everything going on right now the graduation was a nice wholesome moment despite it all. I've also been really enjoying everyone's posts so I thought I would give a quick update on what's going on in my life and in my training too.

### Life Update

My journey to Rochester began with Ross so graciously driving me to the Cleveland train station before sunrise on the second day of finals week. One benefit to the train is that there are always loads of characters. On this ride there were Amish kids running back and forth, a woman moving (by train) from California to Maine to become a social worker, a very sad baby and a middle-aged man who was very cross with the sad baby.

After a few hours of writing papers and eating some breakfast on the train I made it to Rochester and was picked up by the very friendly, and chatty physics undergrad coordinator to move into my new home. I only brought three bags with me, so unfortunately my room is incredibly boring and I would appreciate advice on how to improve/decorate. 

My day to day in Rochester is honestly a blast. To start, I eat a bunch of oatmeal and then go into my office around 9:30 (sometimes 10) to start my work. My job is doing physics research which usually means I'm coding things or going to physics meeting where I listen to the real scientists talk about stuff. Sometimes my boss will come in and we'll watch the code run and write stuff on the blackboard for fun. Overall, work is a 10/10 and it's probably the most fulfilling and best paying job I've had and I'm really glad to be here. 

Once I'm finished work for the day I head to the school's gym, also known as the GAC, to do my training things. When I get home I usually try and convince my roommates to make dinner with me or go to the university's hospital cafeteria to spend our Rochester flex points. After dinner we'll usually try and do something fun like go to minor league baseball or the jazz festival, play Minecraft, or watch both Mamma Mia and Mamma Mia 2. Sometimes I call friends too, so if you want to call pls LMK because I so want to talk to you ðŸ¥°

### Training Update

Luckily I'm now fully recovered from my bike crash but my training has been a little weird because of the stress fracture I had. It turns out that having a stress fracture means you need to build up mileage *very* slowly. For my third week of running I've now built up to a circuit of 5x(3min run, 2 min walk) three times per week. It's pretty frustrating seeing everyone crushing mileage while I've been stuck running 5 miles per week, but I'm so glad to actually be running again (and without pain). 

Since I don't do much running right now I've been doing a bunch of cross training and lifting. I've been doing some stationary biking and I can never figure out how much power I'm actually putting out, one bike will say 280W and another will say 180W. Luckily the GAC also has a pool I can use, so I've been doing a bunch of aqua jogging as well. Aqua jogging is fun because I convinced one of the U of Rochester XC guys to come with me sometimes. I also sometimes lift with some of the Rochester XC people which has been good because it pushes me a lot more and I can actually see my improvements every week. It's so crazy to hear about the Rochester team is because it's so different than our team, but is also similar in a lot of ways...

Anyways, that's it for me. If any of you have advice on how to get swole please comment below. Also give me a call if you want to catch up about your summer or talk about how backwards and broken everything is right now.
