Hi team! I write to you from Boston Logan International Airport, where I am spending the night after a snafu involving trying to check a tuba as oversized luggage. Fear not, all is resolved, but I now find myself with an abundance of time to fill. And so, with the sounds of jet engines purring in the (not so distant) distance, I turn to the blog.

My cot for the night, and a spectacular view of the Boston skyline in the background. A view many would pay well for!

My past week, in stark contrast to the hustle and bustle of the big city, has been spent on Mount Desert Island, specifically Bar Harbor, Maine, where I am living and working for the summer as a sea kayak guide. In addition to work, I have been running on the carriage roads of Acadia National Park and playing tuba on the side of the road when the mood strikes. I hope to encapsulate in this blog post a snapshot of my life at the moment, and hope that you will all do the same.

## Tuesday, June 7

I woke up early with the rising sun after having arrived at the farmhouse (pronounced “fahm house”) the night before. Not having to be at work until 9:00, I ate a leisurely breakfast and explored the property. I’m living in a small house on the island with three of my coworkers, Ozzy, Colby, and Kyle. Although half of the house was destroyed in a fire years ago and seems to have received minimal repair since, it does have a certain charm to it that I find quite enjoyable. I learned some fun (albeit slightly gruesome) facts about the history of the house—feel free to reach out if intrigued.

Looking out into my backyard. A great location for bonfires and Bocce. Also, ticks.

My first day of work consisted of shadowing another guide on two tours so as to learn more about the area. It was a beautiful day on the water. We saw porpoises, seals, eagles, cormorants, terns, starfish, jellyfish, and more! Although it was a long day (a typical work day for guides here is eleven hours), I had a blast and was ready to get after it again.

## Wednesday, June 8

I had to be at work at 8:00, and having taken the day before off had to wake up at 5:45 to go for a run. This was my first day running on the carriage roads, and it was great! Although the cold and fog obscured most of the views, being out in the early morning allowed me close encounters with a snapping turtle, a family of deer, and a lone porcupine.

The kitchen, which fills me with the urge to play chess. The two boxes on top of the fridge are filled with gummy worms. I do not know why or what for.

When I made it back to my car, all the tours for the day had been cancelled due to the weather. Instead, I went to the main shop in downtown Bar Harbor to help some of the staff study for their upcoming guide exams. It’s a rigorous test, so having lots of guides together brainstorming and quizzing one another was a fun exercise. In the afternoon I called Sam Goetz on his drive home from Oberlin and reminisced about the good old days when we lived in Talcott. I then tried to go see Top Gun with my housemates but the movie theater was sold out, so instead I went home to an early bedtime.

## Thursday, June 9

Again I woke up early to run, as will be the case most mornings for the remainder of the summer. This being day two of running on the carriage roads, I was able to recognize some landmarks and begin to feel like I’m learning my way around. Similarly, I am starting to learn my way around the island. I made it to work and back today without using google maps, which I see as a win.

The weather was dreary again, but I was still out on the water. The morning tour was raining and cold, but with thunderstorms forecast in the afternoon we knew the afternoon tour would be cancelled. However, the forecast miraculously cleared and the afternoon tour was on. I ended up spending my lunch break in the kitchen of the restaurant next door, where they graciously allowed me to stand by their oven to get warm/dry. After a long day I was wiped and again went to bed early.

Rainy day out on the water. I know this picture was taken early on in the tour because my fingers could still operate the camera.

## Friday, June 10

Another early morning, but a new route out on the carriage roads. I ran a loop around Eagle Lake, which was super fun. A good six miler, this will likely become a staple this summer. Also, the views were pretty hard to beat.

Views from the trailhead of Eagle Lake. Bluebird skies meant I got fried.

After two days of crummy weather, it was so nice being out on the water! I shadowed the morning tour, then took on the afternoon trip as lead guide for the first time this season. Overall, it went well! With the exception of a singular paddle that seemed to vanish into thin air, there were no casualties. Otherwise, we had some great encounters with the seals and saw some terns drive away a bald eagle from their nest. It was an excellent way to cap off a great first week of work and island life.

That’s all from me for now, team! I hope you all enjoyed. I know for me this killed about an hour in the airport, and now it’s time for some shuteye on this wonderful cot I found. I hope to hear from the rest of you very soon!

Lots of love,

Sam
