Hello team! 

It is a lovely grey morning in Maine. Soon I will roll out of bed and onto the floor, where I will meet Marisa via facetime to have a blessed circuit and subsequent butt-rolling session. Btw anyone is welcome to join us– we do circuits or lift at 8:30am EST every day. Yesterday after the circuit I had the pleasure of watching Marisa feed her friend’s chickens and she experienced me dashing around the house after discovering an ant infestation of a corn chip bag. 

Unfortunately for me my running has come to a halt for a short period of time. When I came home just over a week ago I picked up a rather nasty cough that turned out to be a bacterial lung infection! Fun fun. But the doctor said no run. :(  Thankfully I am on antibiotics and I should be back in the swing of things by Sunday! 

The runs that I did go on before my diagnosis were quite beautiful, though, and I am so happy to be home. 

Alrighty bye for now friends! 

Camila :)
