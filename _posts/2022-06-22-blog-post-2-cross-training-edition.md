Hi team! I’ve enjoyed reading all the blog entries from the past couple weeks, and was inspired by [Jonah’s gripping prose](https://ocxcsummer.github.io/106-degree-diaries-1/) to make this post into a bit of a creative writing project.

## Training Update: June 20th, 2022

This morning I awoke to unusually cool temperatures and a clear sky – a perfect day to get in some cross-training on my bike. I didn’t have a bike on campus last year, so I’ve been cycling around a lot lately. Today, though, I wanted to escape the monotony of looping my neighborhood again and again, and decided to bike onto the seductively smooth paths of the nearby Birdwood Golf Course.

Birdwood Golf Course, c. 2020. Note the seductively smooth path. 

Cycling there, I suspected, was likely prohibited, but I hoped that by sticking to paths and rounding curves at reasonable speeds, I would avoid any issues.

In my garage I mounted my bike, strapped on my helmet, and with my hands on the bike’s intuitively-located brakes, began the ride out of my neighborhood. At a little past eleven o’clock I crossed Morey Creek – the golf course’s Rubicon – onto the green.

Initially, all was well: the sun shone brightly, a cool breeze stirred the leaves, and the few golfers I passed returned my greetings. But before long, I noticed three portly men standing upon a nearby hill, grimacing in my direction. Wary that they might report a sweaty interloper such as myself, I sought to avoid them. But too late I realized that the steep hill I was speeding down would carry me right into their clutches.

As my momentum carried me ineluctably towards them, one of the triumvirate stepped into the path and held out his hand. I slowed, and saw my own image reflected in the iridescent sports glasses which clung to his pudgy face.

“Hey man,” he intoned patronizingly, “You can’t bike on the course.” I attempted to plead ignorance, but pointing behind me, he pronounced, “they’re coming to tell you.” I looked back and saw a golf cart quickly approaching. With my attention distracted, the two other men executed a flanking maneuver to cut off the path ahead.

Hastily, I tried to calculate whether I could evade the authorities: *Is a bike faster than a golf cart? What about on rough terrain? How fast can I accelerate?*

But before I could reach a conclusion, the fairway fuzz was upon me. A young man in a polo shirt and khakis stepped out of the cart, his cap emblazoned with the golf course’s logo. He removed his sunglasses, and suddenly I recognized him – he’d been on my rec basketball team a few years back! Fleetingly, I hoped he might bend the rules for me, but he repeated the ponderous golfers’ warning and evicted me from the green. *Et tu, Gavin?*

As my turncoat friend thanked “Dave” for the report, I biked sadly away, forced to finish my ride on the roads. Eventually, I pulled into my driveway, my heart beating quickly, though heavy with disappointment. On my ride I had broken a heavy sweat, and perhaps the Virginia Misdemeanor Trespassing Statute (§ 18.2-119) as well. But as I stretched on my porch afterwards, I knew that I had completed my cross training; I had *carpe-ed* the *diem*; I had seized the day.
